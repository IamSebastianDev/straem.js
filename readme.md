# StrÃ¦m.js

StrÃ¦m.js is a minimal wrapper for the [Custom Event API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent).

## ğŸš€ Getting started

To use **StrÃ¦m** with npm and/or a bundler such as webpack or rollup, install it via npm:

```bash
npm install straemjs
```

You can also use it directly in the browser and include it via CDN (or locally, if you like).

```html
<head>
  ...
  <!-- as a local file -->
  <script src="./your/path/to/straem.browser.min.js"></script>
  <!-- or via CDN -->
  <script src="http://unpkg.com/straemjs"></script>
  ...
</head>
```
