[![Github tag](https://badgen.net/github/tag/iamsebastiandev/straem.js)](https://github.com/iamsebastiandev/straem.js/tags)

**Str√¶m** is a minimal wrapper for the [Custom Event API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent).

## üöÄ Getting started

To use **Str√¶m** with npm and/or a bundler such as webpack or rollup, install it via yarn or npm:

```bash
yarn add straemjs
# or use npm
npm install straemjs
```

You can also use it directly in the browser and include it via CDN (or locally, if you like).

```html
<head>
    ...
    <!-- as a local file -->
    <script src="./your/path/to/straem.browser.min.js"></script>
    <!-- or via CDN -->
    <script src="http://unpkg.com/straemjs"></script>
    ...
</head>
```

## üîß Usage

### Imports and Global

**Str√¶m** provides exports for modern `import` syntax as well as exports for the `require` syntax.

```js
// node require syntax
const { receive, dispatch } = require('straemjs');

// modern es6 style syntax
import { receive, dispatch } from 'straemjs';
```

In case you included the **Str√¶m** file via CDN, the `straem` object is globally available.

```js
const { receive, dispatch } = straem;
```

### Creating a custom event listener

To receive and listen to custom (or built-in) event, use the `receive()` method

```js
import { receive } from 'straemjs';

// Use the receive method to register one or more event names for the listener

const listener = receive('custom-event', 'another-event');

// You can use the 'from' method to set the target of the event

const listener = receive('custom-event').from(window);

// To create the listener(s) and register a callback, use the 'then' method returned by
// either the 'receive' or 'from' method and pass a handler and an optional opinions object.
// The method returns a function to remove the created listener(s).

const dispose = receive('custom-event').then(handler, eventInit);
```

### Dispatching a custom event

To dispatch a custom event, use the `dispatch()` method.

```js
import { dispatch } from 'straemjs';

// Use the dispatch method to register one ore more event names for dispatching.
// As with the receive method, you can chain the from method to set the target.

const send = dispatch('custom-event').from(window);

// Use the 'with' method to dispatch the event with a given payload.

send.with({ hello: 'world' });
```

## API

## `receive()`

Type: `receive(...string: string[]) => { from: Function, then: Function, eventTarget: EventTarget, eventNames: string[] }`

The receive method is used to create a custom event listener. Pass any number of strings as argument. The method returns the `Receiver` object, containing the `from()`, `then()`, `eventTarget` & `eventNames` properties.

## `dispatch()`

Type: `dispatch(...string: string[]) => { from: Function, with: Function, eventTarget: EventTarget, eventNames: string[] }`

The dispatch method is used to create a custom event dispatcher. Pass any number of strings as argument. The method returns the `Dispatcher` object, containing the `from()`, `with()`, `eventTarget` & `eventNames` properties.

## `Receiver.from() / Dispatcher.from()`

Type: `from(eventTarget: EventTarget) => { this }`

The from method is used to set the eventTarget of the `receive()`of `dispatch()` methods. The method will return the receive of dispatch object, respective of the method that it was called from.

## `Receiver.then()`

Type: `then<T>(action: Action<T>, eventInit?: AddEventListenerOptions) => function`

The then method is used to execute the specified handler function when the custom event is received. The method takes a `eventInit` object as second parameter, which is equal to the options provided by the [Event interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/Event). The method returns a function to remove all created listeners.

## `Dispatcher.with()`

Type: `with(payload?: any, eventInit?: EventInit) => void`

The with method is used to dispatch the created event from the `dispatch()` method with a specified payload. The method takes a `eventInit` object as second parameter, which is equal to the options provided by the [Event interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/Event). The payload will default to `undefined` if not specified.
